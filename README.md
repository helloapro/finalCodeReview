## Features

_This program will calculate attributes of the form submitted in order to output the correct pricing for the pizza order, adding together both the price of the size selected as well as the number of toppings added._

## Specifications
* Spec #1: The program should price the pizza based on size selected.
  * Example Input: User selects large size.
  * Example Output: Price of pizza = $8.
* Spec #2: The program should calculate additional pizza pricing by counting the number of toppings selected by user and multiplying by $0.50.
  * Example Input: User selects large size and checkmarks three topping boxes (e.g. pepperoni, mushrooms, and cheddar).
  * Example Output: Price of pizza = $9.50

Additional specs to add in future:
* Spec #3: The program should allow users to add and save a second pizza to their order.
  * Example Input: User selects 'add pizza' button and puts in for a small pizza with just mozzarella (in addition to the large with 3 toppings above).
  * Example Output: Price of 2 pizzas = $16.
* Spec #4: The program should allow users to input an address for delivery.
  * Example Input: 1100 SW 6th Ave.
  * Example Output: Your two pizzas come to $16! We'll have your order out to you within 30 minutes at 1100 SW 6th Ave.

## Known Bugs
May put cheese selector in a separate section once final pricing is decided. That may not be an item to charge as a topping...
